# Auth Decision Log

- Current task: `AUTH-DB002-CONTRACT-001`
- Scope: `DOCUMENTATION_ONLY`
- Evidence baseline: `739a331c9942ed64a1ad8276d611889bbee53a27`
- Auth implementation: `NOT_STARTED`
- Auth runtime: `NOT_TESTED`

## `AUTH-DEC-001` — Contract-first dependency bridge

Publish `CONTRACT-AUTH-001` before A2-DATABASE begins Auth-owned DB-002
persistence. A2-DATABASE acknowledgement and accepted
`CONTRACT-WORKFLOW-001` remain required.

## `AUTH-DEC-002` — UUID internal human identity

Canonical users and other Auth conceptual records use UUID internal IDs;
external identifiers remain separate.

## `AUTH-DEC-003` — Provider-neutral external identity

Opaque, case-sensitive `issuer + subject` is unique and maps to one canonical
user. Email and mutable login names are not authorization keys.

## `AUTH-DEC-004` — No local credential persistence

DB-002 requires no password hash or local credential field. Raw secrets and
provider tokens are excluded from ordinary domain tables.

## `AUTH-DEC-005` — Exact repository authorization tuple

Repository access is deny-by-default and scoped by the exact
user-installation-repository tuple; grants never cross tuple members.

## `AUTH-DEC-006` — Provider-neutral Database boundary

The contract defines semantics only. A2-DATABASE owns physical schema,
constraints, indexes, ORM, PostgreSQL, migrations, and migration ordering.

## `AUTH-DEC-007` — Lifecycle denial and historical attribution

Inactive lifecycle states deny new actions without deleting historical actor,
installation, repository, or access attribution.

## `AUTH-DEC-008` — Canonical actor types

The actor vocabulary is `HUMAN_USER`, `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION`,
`SYSTEM_SERVICE`, and `UNAUTHENTICATED`, with human and machine identities kept
distinct.

## `AUTH-DEC-009` — No generic permission tables for DB-002

The initial action vocabulary is semantic. DB-002 adds no enterprise tenancy,
generic roles, permission tables, user-role tables, or billing.

## `AUTH-DEC-010` — Initial contract version

The published draft is `CONTRACT-AUTH-001` version `1.0.0-draft.1`, status
`DRAFT_FOR_CONSUMER_REVIEW`. Breaking semantic changes require a major version
and coordinated Database and Integration review.

No decision in this log authorizes Auth code, tests, or DB-002 implementation.
The shared registry's missing Database consumer remains an owner correction.
